# SimpleTheMovieDB

A brutally simple wrapper on the themoviedb.com API. The library that powers [Love4Movies](http://love4movies.com).

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'simple_themoviedb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_themoviedb

## Usage

First of all, initialize a client:

```ruby
require 'simple_themoviedb'
@client = SimpleTheMovieDB::Client.new('your-api-key')
```

The SimpleTheMovieDB::Client has a few methods at your disposal:

- #search

Accepts one string (the query) as parameter. Returns an Array of Hashes. Each Hash contains a summarized version of the movie data.

```ruby
@client.search('The Wolf of Wall Street')
 => [{"vote_count"=>8895, "id"=>106646, "video"=>false, "vote_average"=>7.9, "title"=>"The Wolf of Wall Street", "popularity"=>36.903397, "poster_path"=>"/vK1o5rZGqxyovfIhZyMELhk03wO.jpg", "original_language"=>"en", "original_title"=>"The Wolf of Wall Street", "genre_ids"=>[80, 18, 35], "backdrop_path"=>"/rP36Rx5RQh0rmH2ynEIaG8DxbV2.jpg", "adult"=>false, "overview"=>"A New York stockbroker refuses to cooperate in a large securities fraud case involving corruption on Wall Street, corporate banking world and mob infiltration.

```
